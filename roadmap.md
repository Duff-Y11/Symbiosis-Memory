# Roadmap: Symbiosis-Memory

This roadmap outlines the development stages of **Symbiosis-Memory**, from theoretical foundation to enterprise-ready architecture.

---

## ðŸ”¹ v0.1 â€” Theory & Design (Current Stage)
- Define the philosophy of AI memory inspired by human cognition.
- Document memory layers: **short-term, mid-term, long-term**.
- Document forgetting mechanisms: **decay, compression, manual deletion**.
- Establish the repository structure and documentation.

---

## ðŸ”¹ v0.2 â€” Prototype (Experimental Implementation)
- Build a minimal working prototype using **JSON/SQLite** for memory storage.
- Implement:
  - Short-term memory buffer (last N turns).
  - Mid-term memory with frequency-based promotion.
  - Basic forgetting/cleanup process.
- CLI or simple API for testing.

---

## ðŸ”¹ v0.3 â€” Scalable Memory System
- Integrate **Vector Database** (e.g., Weaviate, Milvus, Pinecone) for semantic retrieval.
- Introduce summarization and compression pipelines.
- Implement automatic promotion/demotion of memories across layers.
- Add logging and visibility into what is remembered or forgotten.

---

## ðŸ”¹ v0.4 â€” Multi-User & Context-Aware Memory
- Support memory separation across multiple users.
- Role- and context-specific memory handling.
- Add permissions for memory access, editing, and deletion.
- Basic audit trail for compliance.

---

## ðŸ”¹ v1.0 â€” Enterprise-Ready Memory Architecture
- Full **memory orchestration system** with APIs.
- Compliance with privacy laws (GDPR/CCPA).
- Advanced forgetting strategies (hierarchical decay, weighted priorities).
- Integration with external systems (e.g., knowledge bases, company data).
- Dashboard for monitoring memory usage, decay, and retention.

---

## ðŸš€ Beyond v1.0 (Future Research Directions)
- Hybrid architectures combining symbolic + neural memory.
- Memory compression inspired by neuroscience.
- Ethical frameworks for long-term AI memory and identity.
- Self-adaptive memory policies that evolve with user behavior.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Summary
The roadmap moves from **theory (v0.1)** â†’ **prototype (v0.2)** â†’ **scalable system (v0.3)** â†’ **multi-user and compliance (v0.4)** â†’ **enterprise-ready architecture (v1.0)**.  
Future directions extend toward advanced research in memory, cognition, and ethics.
