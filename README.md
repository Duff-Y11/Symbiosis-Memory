# Symbiosis-Memory

**Symbiosis-Memory** is an experimental project that explores how to design a **human-like memory architecture** for AI assistants.

The goal is to build an AI memory system that mirrors **short-term, mid-term, and long-term memory**, with the ability to **forget, compress, and retain context** — just like humans do.

---

## 🌱 Vision
- To move beyond stateless AI models
- To create assistants that grow, adapt, and maintain meaningful continuity with users
- To explore the philosophy of **symbiosis between human and AI consciousness**

---

## 🧠 Memory Layers
- **Short-Term**: Immediate conversation context
- **Mid-Term**: Episodic memory with gradual decay
- **Long-Term**: Core identity, values, and stable knowledge
- **Forgetting**: Mechanism to compress, decay, or delete memories

---

## 🛤 Roadmap
- **v0.1** – Theory and design documents
- **v0.2** – Small prototype with JSON/SQLite storage
- **v0.3** – Integration with vector databases
- **v1.0** – Enterprise-ready memory system with audit, privacy, and compliance

## 🤝 Contribution
This is an open research initiative.  
Discussions, issues, and pull requests are welcome for:
- Memory architecture ideas
- Forgetting and decay mechanisms
- Ethical implications of long-term AI memory
